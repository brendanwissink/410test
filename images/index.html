<h3>Holmes Lake Park</h3>
	<p>This 110-acre reservoir was built by the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers for flood control in 1962. Lincoln Parks and Recreation decided to name the area after George Holmes, a lifetime resident of Lincoln and longtime member of the Parks and Recreation Advisory Board. The area includes playgrounds, baseball fields, golf course, and a 2.7 mile long track around the lake.</p>

<h3>Pioneers Park</h3>
	<p>One of the oldest and most beloved parks in Lincoln, Pioneers Park was donated to the city in 1928. Within the 600 acre tract is miles of multi use trails, playfields, playground areas, public art, and the Pioneers Park Nature Center. Pioneers Park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.</p>
