<h2>Kindred Spirit</h2>
	<p>Founded on the trails in Lincoln, meeting each other on the benches cathing breaths. A spark was formed on how to spread information on different paths to blaze, events to join, and people to meet. Herdles was founded to help break the monotony of sitting in an office everyday with interest of growing friend circles and making the comminity happier. Our group is not about the race but the journey we all go through together.</p>

<h3>Community</h3>
	<p>The community is important to us as we use the streets and parks provided here. We partner with local events such as the children's Mayor's Run around the Capitol Building, to the Lincoln Marathon. We also reach out to local businesses to see if they would like to partner with a fun run for the day earning fun prizes for showing up and joining in the fun. We also research into virtual runs to joing where the locations doesn't matter but you can join up with others in the event and earn a medal.</p>
